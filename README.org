#+title: Hello there

My name is Wojtek and I do some stuff on the internet. I do some coding as a 
hobby, and also way more coding as a job.

I use Linux and really like, to the point I have a YouTube channel where I talk
a lot about it.

By day I'm a Magento developer, and by night I do some FOSS projects of my own
(mainly Vim-related) and contribute to some other if I can.
