My name is Wojtek and I do some stuff on the internet. I do some coding as a
hobby, and also way more coding as a job.

I use Linux and I really like it, to the point I have a YouTube channel where I
talk a lot about it.

By day I'm a Magento developer, and by night I do some FOSS projects of my own
and contribute to some other if I can.
