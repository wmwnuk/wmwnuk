My name is Wojtek and I do some stuff on the internet. I do some coding
as a hobby, and also way more coding as a job.

I use Linux and really like it, to the point I have a YouTube channel where
I talk a lot about it.

By day I'm a Magento developer, and by night I do some FOSS projects of
my own (mainly Vim-related) and contribute to some other if I can.
